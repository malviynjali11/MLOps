1. Class and Objects (with examples)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods 
    => Code walkthrough 
    => Attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP ?
   Everything in Python is an Object (data structure, data type etc.)
4. Advantages of OOPS concept :
    => we can create our own datatype 
    => code reusability 
    => debugging 
    => easy to colab 
5. End to End Project (Chatbook class)
    => function v/s method
    => magic method or dunder method
    => self
    => we can create attribute outside class as well
    => encapsulation 
    => getter and setter 
    => static method 
    => inheritance
