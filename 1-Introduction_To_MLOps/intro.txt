Basic Required before moving to MLOps - 

1. Python Programming basics, VS Code, Anaconda env etc.
2. Basic hands-on experience of a Data Science proj lifestyle .
3. Machine Learning understanding .
4. Existing account on Github and AWS/Azure/GCP 

Introduction to MLOps - 

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) are a set of practices that automate and simplify ML workflow and deployments. It is the
development and use of ML models by development Operations (DevOps) teams. MLOps adds discipline to the development and 
deployments of ML models, making the development process more reliable and productive.
ML Design - gather requirements, prioritize ML use cases, business understanding, data acquisition .
Model Development - Data prep and processing, feature engineering, model training/experimentations, model analysis and 
evaluation 
Operations - ML model deployment, CI/CD pipeline, Model Monitoring and triggering .

Issues with DS practice without MLOps - 

1. Low Coding standards - OOPS concept, Modular coding, logging, exception etc
2. No data Management - Data Ingestion/Articrafts etc
3. Versioning - Code, Data, Model 
4. Data Pipeline/Experiments 
5. No CICD [Continous Integration Continous Deployment] concept 
6. Scalability and Monitoring (Production) - Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana 
7. Cross team friction 

Software development LifeCycle (SDLC) - 

1. Requirement Analysis 
2. Defining 
3. Designing 
4. Coding 
5. Testing 
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance 

Development/ML => Development, Testing, Q&A Team, Docker 
OPS => Delivery, Deployment, Maintenance
MLOps = Development + OPS 

What we will be learning - 

1. Code standards - OOPS concept, modular coding, work with logginig module for better debugging, managing
(artifacts, components, pipeline etc)
2. Code Versioning - Git & Github (Bitbucket, GitLab)
3. Data/Model Versioning, maintaining data pipeline & experimentations - DVC, MLflow (Neptune, Seldon, Kubeflow
, ZenML)
4. CICD tools - Github Actions, CircleCI, TravisCI 
5. Containerization for code reliability - Docker and Dockerhub 
6. Scalability and Monitoring - Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana
7. AWS Series - IAM User, ECR, S3, EC2 etc

All in one services - AWS Sagemaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure ML 

First we cover MLOps tools then move to end to end project 
Watch first to understand, once clear then go for hand-on 
We'll focus more on MLOps rather than data cleaning or model building part 
From project building to applying for jobs
